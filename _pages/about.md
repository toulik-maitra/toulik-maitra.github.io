  <p>
    I am Toulik Maitra, a doctoral candidate in Chemical Engineering at 
    <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>, working with Professor 
    Adam Moulé. I am also a visiting fellow at the 
    <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research</a> 
    in Mainz, Germany, where I collaborate with the <em>Molecular Electronics Group</em> on developing 
    polarizable force fields for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) OLED emitters and contribute 
    to the VOTCA software platform.

    I am from Madanpur, a small village in West Bengal, India. 
    Curiosity shaped my early learning, and that sense of exploration continues to guide my research. 
    I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Calcutta in 2020, 
    where I studied hierarchical nanostructures for applications in photovoltaics and 
    photoelectrochemical water splitting. My undergraduate work led to five peer-reviewed publications 
    and introduced me to the value of experimentation combined with design.

  <h2 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Research and Scientific Vision</h2>
  <p>
    My research seeks to understand the role of molecular disorder in 
    <strong>organic semiconductor materials</strong>. I combine 
    <strong>inelastic neutron scattering (INS)</strong> spectroscopy with 
    <strong>quantum chemical and condensed matter simulations</strong> to reveal how structural 
    dynamics influence charge transport and optoelectronic properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside this work, I develop <strong>polarizable force fields</strong> for TADF emitters and 
    contribute to <strong>open-source computational chemistry tools</strong>. These projects aim to 
    bridge experimental observations with atomistic simulations, providing a deeper understanding of 
    molecular interactions that govern material performance.

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Questions That Drive My Research</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
    <li>How can we design organic semiconductors with superior charge carrier mobility?</li>
    <li>What approaches allow polymeric materials to be simulated efficiently with minimal resources?</li>
    <li>How can disorder information be extracted directly from neutron spectroscopy data?</li>
    <li>What modeling strategies improve TADF force fields and OLED device performance?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Interests Beyond Research</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that the most challenging problems often find their solutions at the intersection of disciplines. 
    This conviction has guided my journey from experimental chemistry to business strategy, and now to 
    computational research. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on designing and synthesizing 
    dye-sensitized solar cells and water-splitting systems, gaining hands-on experience in renewable energy 
    technologies. Recognizing the importance of using scientific innovation into viable business models, 
    I participated in a Business Model Competition, which led to an internship as a business analyst at 
    <strong>TATA Autocomps Systems Ltd.</strong>, where I conducted feasibility studies for production processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I began my PhD, I intentionally sought to explore new research realms by transitioning to 
    computational modeling, a decision that has profoundly shaped my perspective. My experience across 
    experimental chemistry, business analysis, and computational research has given me a unique lens: 
    I see deep technology not just as scientific advancement, but as a strategic asset with commercial 
    and investment potential. I am passionate about translating research into scalable solutions that 
    create value for industries, investors, and society. My goal is to serve as a bridge between science 
    and business—advancing the field while growing companies that can transform innovative research into 
    meaningful impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond my research, I maintain a balanced life through activities. 
    I'm an avid soccer player and supporter (Manchester United), finding inspiration in the teamwork, 
    strategy, and discipline that the sport demands. I love adventure in the outdoors, whether hiking, 
    camping, or simply exploring new landscapes. Reading is another hobby, recently, I've been 
    captivated by Ed Yong's <em>An Immense World</em>, which explores how different animals perceive 
    reality, reminding me that there are always new perspectives to discover. These interests, 
    combined with my core values of curiosity, discipline, and integrity, have been essential companions 
    on my journey from a small village in West Bengal to international research collaborations. They 
    continue to shape not just how I approach science, but how I engage with the world.
