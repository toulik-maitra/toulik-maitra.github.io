## Course Overview

ECH 141: Introduction to Fluid Mechanics is an undergraduate course offered by the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Davis. 

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Review Classes**: I taught 2 classes reviewing the core concepts before the exams, ensuring that students were well-prepared.
- **Discussion Sessions**: I facilitated weekly discussion sessions, where we went over assignment problems and clarified any doubts.
- **Curriculum**: I covered fundamental topics in fluid mechanics, extending up to the Navier-Stokes equations.
