My name is Toulik Maitra, and I am currently a doctoral candidate in Chemical Engineering at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>, working under Professor Adam Moul√©. 

I'm also a visiting fellow at the <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research</a> in Mainz, Germany, collaborating with the Molecular Electronics Group on polarizable force fields for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and contributing to the VOTCA software package.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University of Calcutta, India, in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable experience in the field of hierarchical nanostructures for applications in photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical water-splitting. My undergraduate research work resulted in five published articles in peer-reviewed journals.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding disorder in organic semiconductor materials by analyzing their phonon spectra using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy. I'm also working on developing polarizable force fields for TADF emitters and contributing to computational chemistry software development.

I use quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics approaches to explore several key questions:

* How can we design organic semiconductors with better charge carrier mobility?
* How can we analyze polymeric materials more efficiently with limited computational resources?
* How can we extract disorder information from INS data?
* How can we develop better force fields for TADF materials to improve OLED performance?

My aspiration is to develop methodologies that can unveil new aspects of our understanding of organic semiconductors, surpassing the capabilities of current density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
