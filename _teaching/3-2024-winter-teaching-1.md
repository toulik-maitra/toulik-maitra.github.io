## Course Overview

General Chemistry is an undergraduate course offered by the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Discussion Sessions**: I held 2 discussion sessions every week to teach core concepts and solve assignments. These sessions covered topics from thermochemistry to chemical bonding and molecular orbital theory.
- **Lab Sessions**: I supervised weekly lab sessions where students engaged in experiments. These experiments included concepts from thermochemistry to determining the depression of the freezing point and the elevation of the boiling point.
