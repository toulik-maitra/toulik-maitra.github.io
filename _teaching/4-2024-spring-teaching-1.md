Similarly as CHE002B, the most fulfilling aspect of teaching chemistry was the ability to convey complex concepts in a captivating and amusing way, enabling students to visualize and grasp the underlying equations more effectively. This course has been instrumental in enhancing my research capabilities and solidifying my fundamental understanding of the subject matter. It was truly rewarding to observe students actively applying theoretical principles to practical experiments, all while fostering an enjoyable and uplifting learning environment filled with smiles and a sense of enthusiasm for the subject matter. 

## Course Overview

General Chemistry 2C is an undergraduate course offered by the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Discussion Sessions**: I held one discussion session every week to teach core concepts and solve assignments. These sessions covered topics from electrochemistry to chemical kinetics.
- **Lab Sessions**: I supervised weekly lab sessions where students engaged in practical experiments. These experiments included making galvanic cells in electrochemistry and determining the kinetics of coordination compound complexes.
