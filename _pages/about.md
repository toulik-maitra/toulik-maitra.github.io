My name is Toulik Maitra, and I am currently a doctoral candidate in the field of Chemical Engineering at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>. I am conducting my research under the guidance of Professor Adam Moul√©. 

I am also serving as a visiting fellow at the <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research</a> in Mainz, Germany, where I'm working with the Molecular Electronics Group on developing polarizable force fields for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and contributing to the VOTCA software package.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University of Calcutta, India, in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable experience in the field of hierarchical nanostructures for applications in photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical water-splitting. My undergraduate research work resulted in five published articles in peer-reviewed journals.

## Research Interest:

The central focus of my research is the quantification of disorder in various organic semiconductor materials through the analysis of their phonon spectra, employing the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy technique. Additionally, I work on developing polarizable force fields for TADF emitters and contribute to computational chemistry software packages.

I leverage concepts and tools from quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics to formalize and explore novel questions arising from the following areas:

* How can we design organic semiconductors with enhanced charge carrier mobility?
* How can we analyze polymeric materials using minimal computational resources?
* How can we extract disorder from INS data?
* How can we develop accurate force fields for TADF materials to improve OLED design?

My aspiration is to develop methodologies that can unveil new aspects of our understanding of organic semiconductors, surpassing the capabilities of current density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
