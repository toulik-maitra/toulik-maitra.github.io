**Personal Learning**: Throughout this course, I have been able to enhance my research capabilities and solidify my fundamental understanding of the subject matter, as it covered basic organic chemistry and complex experiments. 

## Course Overview

General Chemistry 2C is a Freshman/Sophmore level undergraduate course offered by the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Discussion Sessions**: I held one discussion session every week to teach core concepts and solve assignments. These sessions covered topics from electrochemistry to chemical kinetics.
- **Lab Sessions**: I supervised weekly lab sessions where students engaged in practical experiments. These experiments included making galvanic cells in electrochemistry and determining the kinetics of coordination compound complexes.
