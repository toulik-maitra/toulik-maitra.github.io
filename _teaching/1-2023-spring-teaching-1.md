**Personal Learning**: This course has enhanced my ability to communicate science to a broad audience. Additionally, I've acquired new knowledge, such as crystal structures and the Miller indices convention.


## Course Overview

ENG 045: Properties of Materials is a Junior/Senior level undergraduate course offered by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of California, Davis.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Lab Sessions**: I supervised weekly lab sessions where students performed practical experiments. These experiments included evaluating the elasticity of various materials and determining the energy gap of semiconductors such as Germanium (Ge) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).
- **Discussion Sessions**: I held weekly discussion sessions to clarify the concepts of material properties, covering topics from crystal structures to the basics of semiconductor physics.
