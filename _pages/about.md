My name is **Toulik Maitra**, and I am currently a doctoral candidate in **Chemical Engineering** at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am conducting my research under the guidance of **Professor Adam Moul√©**.

I obtained my **Bachelor's degree** from the **University of Calcutta, India**, in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable experience in the field of hierarchical nanostructures for applications in **photovoltaics** and **photoelectrochemical water-splitting**. My undergraduate research work resulted in **five published articles** in peer-reviewed journals.

## Research Focus

The central focus of my research is the **quantification of disorder** in various organic semiconductor materials through the analysis of their **phonon spectra**, employing the **inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy** technique.

I leverage concepts and tools from **quantum chemistry** and **condensed matter physics** to formalize and explore novel questions arising from the following areas:

* **Charge Carrier Mobility**: How can we design organic semiconductors with enhanced charge carrier mobility?
* **Computational Efficiency**: How can we analyze polymeric materials using minimal computational resources?
* **Disorder Analysis**: How can we extract disorder from INS data?
