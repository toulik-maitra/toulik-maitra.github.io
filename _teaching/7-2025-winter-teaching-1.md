**Personal Learning**: Through this course, I enhanced my MATLAB programming skills while applying them to biological process control systems. 

## Course Overview

EBS 130: Biological Process Control Systems is a higher lever undergraduate-level course that combines programming fundamentals with biological process control theory. The course emphasizes the application of MATLAB for modeling and analyzing biological control systems.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I was involved in:

- **MATLAB Programming Sessions**: Led hands-on programming sessions where students learned to implement control systems algorithms using MATLAB. This included creating simulations of biological feedback systems and analyzing system responses.
- **Problem-Solving Workshops**: Conducted weekly workshops focusing on practical applications of control theory in biological systems, helping students develop both their programming and analytical skills.
- **Project Guidance**: Assisted students in developing their final projects, which involved modeling and simulating various biological control systems using MATLAB.

Key topics covered included:
- Introduction to MATLAB programming for biological systems
- Mathematical modeling of biological processes
- Feedback control systems in biological applications
- System dynamics and stability analysis
- PID controller design and implementation
