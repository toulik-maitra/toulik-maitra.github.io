  <h1 style="font-size:2rem;font-weight:700;margin-bottom:0.5rem;">About Me</h1>
  <hr style="border:0;border-top:2px solid #eee;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">

  <p>
    I am <strong>Toulik Maitra</strong>, a doctoral candidate in <strong>Chemical Engineering</strong> at 
    <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis</a>, working with Professor 
    <strong>Adam Moulé</strong>. I am also a <strong>visiting fellow</strong> at the 
    <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research</a> 
    in Mainz, Germany, where I collaborate with the <em>Molecular Electronics Group</em> on developing 
    polarizable force fields for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and contribute 
    to the <strong>VOTCA</strong> software platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic journey began in a small village in <strong>West Bengal, India</strong>. 
    Curiosity shaped my early learning, and that sense of exploration continues to guide my research. 
    I completed my <strong>Bachelor’s degree at the University of Calcutta</strong> in 2020, 
    where I studied hierarchical nanostructures for applications in photovoltaics and 
    photoelectrochemical water splitting. My undergraduate work led to five peer-reviewed publications 
    and introduced me to the value of rigorous experimentation combined with purposeful design.

  <h2 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Research and Scientific Vision</h2>
  <p>
    My research seeks to understand the role of molecular disorder in 
    <strong>organic semiconductor materials</strong>. I combine 
    <strong>inelastic neutron scattering (INS)</strong> spectroscopy with 
    <strong>quantum chemical and condensed matter simulations</strong> to reveal how structural 
    dynamics influence charge transport and optoelectronic properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside this work, I develop <strong>polarizable force fields</strong> for TADF emitters and 
    contribute to <strong>open-source computational chemistry tools</strong>. These projects aim to 
    bridge experimental observations with atomistic simulations, providing a deeper understanding of 
    molecular interactions that govern material performance.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;font-size:1.2rem;">Questions That Drive My Research</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left:1.5rem;">
    <li>How can we design organic semiconductors with superior charge carrier mobility?</li>
    <li>What approaches allow polymeric materials to be simulated efficiently with minimal resources?</li>
    <li>How can disorder information be extracted directly from neutron spectroscopy data?</li>
    <li>What modeling strategies improve TADF force fields and OLED device performance?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Interests Beyond Research</h2>
  <p>
    I am deeply interested in the intersection of <strong>science, strategy, and investment</strong>. 
    My exposure to computational modeling and materials innovation has shaped a perspective that 
    connects deep technology with its commercial and strategic impact. I enjoy exploring how 
    research translates into scalable solutions that can influence industries and investment decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the academic environment, I enjoy <strong>playing soccer</strong>, exploring the outdoors, 
    and reading. I value curiosity, discipline, and integrity. These principles have guided me from a 
    small Indian village to international research collaborations, shaping my approach to both science 
    and life.

    “Science and strategy share a common foundation — both seek clarity in complexity, and both reward those who ask better questions.”
