**Personal Learning**: In this course, I learned the process of making good coffee with the resources available. I have discovered how even small factors, such as water temperature, brewing method, and pH levels, can significantly impact the flavor.

## Course Overview

Coffee Lab is a Freshman level undergraduate course offered by the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Davis.

### Teaching Experience

Throughout the course, I conducted the following:

- **Lab Sessions**: I supervised weekly three-lab sessions where students engaged in practical experiments. These experiments included making coffee using different brewing method and understanding fundamental Chemical Engineering concepts like fluid dynamics and mass transfer.
